## What it is

Mugetsu is an **unofficial, modified build of [Ruffle](https://ruffle.rs)**, the open-source Flash Player
emulator that Artix's own Game Launcher also uses. It plays AQW straight from Artix's servers; no game
files are included or changed.

All the changes are inside the player:

- drawing work spread over all CPU cores
- avatar effects and glows drawn together on shared canvases instead of one by one (since 1.3:
  several times faster on laptops and built-in graphics)
- much less work per frame in fights and when changing rooms
- fixed memory leaks that made long sessions slower and slower
- smoother mouse handling and frame pacing
- fixes for crashes on AMD graphics and on graphics cards that run out of memory, and much less
  graphics memory used in heavy fights

It **does not** change gameplay, automate anything, or give any advantage. It just draws the same game faster.

## How much faster?

In crowded rooms like Yulgar, Mugetsu held a steady **24 FPS** in testing (at a 24 FPS game setting).
On the same PC, Flash drops to **7–10 FPS** and standard Ruffle to **8–16 FPS**: Mugetsu is
**up to 3× faster** than both.

On a laptop with Intel UHD 620 graphics (Quality Low), version 1.3 holds **30 FPS** in a crowded room
where version 1.2 managed about 20, and draws each frame about **3.5× faster**.

## Requirements

- Windows 10 or 11, 64-bit, or 64-bit Linux from about 2022 on (Ubuntu 22.04, Debian 12, Fedora 36,
  SteamOS 3 or newer; Linux uses Vulkan or OpenGL, details in the README inside the Linux download),
  or macOS 11 (Big Sur) or newer on Apple silicon or Intel (uses Metal; details in the README inside
  the macOS download)
- A graphics card with **Vulkan** (NVIDIA GTX 600 / AMD Radeon HD 7000 / Intel 6th-gen Core or newer).
  On Intel and Qualcomm (Snapdragon) graphics, Mugetsu uses DirectX 12 (their Vulkan drivers crash
  or show a black window on several chips); since 1.1 it runs about as well as Vulkan. Without Vulkan,
  Mugetsu also uses DirectX 12 and tells you so, and if a graphics driver crashes when Vulkan starts,
  it switches to DirectX 12 by itself. To choose yourself, **right-click Mugetsu's title bar** → Graphics: Automatic, Vulkan
  or DirectX 12 (try DirectX 12 if the window stays black or stutters).
- **Graphics memory:** 2 GB minimum (with AQW's Quality set to **Low**), 4 GB or more recommended
- **RAM:** 8 GB minimum, 16 GB recommended
- **CPU with AVX2** (Windows and Linux): Intel 4th-gen Core (2013) or newer, AMD Ryzen or newer

## How to use

1. Download the `-windows.zip` from **[Releases](https://github.com/mugetsu-aqw/mugetsu/releases/latest)** and unzip it anywhere.
2. Run `Mugetsu.exe`. The first time, Windows may say *"Windows protected your PC"* because the program
   isn't signed by a known publisher: click **More info → Run anyway**.
3. Log in as usual.

**macOS:** unzip the `-macos-universal.zip` and open `Mugetsu.app`. The first time, macOS blocks it
because it isn't notarized by Apple: open **System Settings → Privacy & Security**, click **Open Anyway**
next to the message about Mugetsu, then confirm. The README inside the download has the steps for older macOS.

**Settings:** right-click anywhere on the game for Mugetsu's menu: **Frame interpolation** (smoother motion on
strong PCs, off by default), **Edge smoothing**, **Graphics**, **Show FPS**, **Full screen** and **Open log folder**.

**Low FPS on a laptop or older PC?** In AQW's Options, set **Quality to Low**. Since 1.5.0, Medium and High
cost much less than before on built-in graphics, but Low is still the fastest. If Mugetsu notices built-in
graphics running slowly on Medium or High, it shows this tip once; it never changes the setting for you.

## Safety and privacy

- **Nothing is installed**, no admin rights needed. Delete the folder to remove it.
- **Your password never touches Mugetsu**: you log in on AQW's own login screen, loaded from Artix's servers.
- **No tracking or telemetry.** The only connections are to Artix's game servers; once, to Cisco to
  download the free OpenH264 video decoder Ruffle uses for in-game videos; and once at startup, to
  GitHub to check whether there's a newer Mugetsu version (nothing about you is sent; it only shows a
  message, nothing is downloaded). To switch the check off, put an empty file named `no-update-check`
  next to `Mugetsu.exe`.
- **The log file contains no account details** (no email, username or chat).
- **Open source.** All of Mugetsu's code is public in the [`source`](source) folder (GPL-3.0), and from version
  1.3.1 on, every release is built from it by GitHub Actions: each build's page shows its log and the SHA-256 of
  the zip it made.

- **SHA-256** of each release file is listed on its release page, so you can check your download.

## FAQ

**Is this a bot or a cheat?**
No. It doesn't automate anything, change any game files, or send anything the game doesn't send itself.
It's a faster version of the same player Artix's launcher uses.

**Is it allowed?**
Mugetsu isn't affiliated with or endorsed by Artix Entertainment or the Ruffle project. It only changes how
the unmodified game is drawn, but use it at your own risk and check AQW's Terms of Service if you're unsure.

**Why does Windows warn me the first time?**
Mugetsu isn't code-signed (that costs money and requires a public identity), so Windows SmartScreen
doesn't recognize the publisher. Check the VirusTotal scan and the SHA-256 above if you want to verify it,
or read the source code it's built from.

**Where are the logs and settings?**
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\ruffle` (the log is replaced each time you start Mugetsu).
